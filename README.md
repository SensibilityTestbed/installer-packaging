# installer-packaging

This repository provides the various parts (code, tools, other content) 
that are necessary to build and package Seattle *base installers* for the main 
operating systems and platforms we support. In their current form, the tools 
are intended for use only in the 
[Custom Installer Builder](https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/custominstallerbuilder)
and/or CIB admins, not end users.

Each base installer contains the Seattle runtime, nodemanager, etc., and all 
of the platform abstractions required to install, run, and autostart Seattle, 
*but* lacks the user keys (in the form of the `vesselinfo` file) required to 
actually perform the installation and provide remote-accessible resources 
afterwards.
The CIB knows how to create this `vesselinfo` file and add it so that the resulting 
installer is complete.

Tools include
* A packaging script that generates Seattle installers for different platforms, and
* A script to sign and "push" (put in the appropriate web server dir) software updates.

# Using this repo

Clone this repo, then run the initialization script (which git-clones all 
of installer-packaging's dependencies) and build script (which prepares 
the Python source files and platform-specific installer stuff).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/installer-packaging
$ cd installer-packaging/scripts
$ python initialize.py
$ python build.py
```

Several new directories are created thus:
* `../RUNNABLE` now contains the script to build new base installers,
* `../RUNNABLE/seattle_repy` holds the general Seattle runtime, nodemanager, 
etc.,
* and `../RUNNABLE/seattle_linux`, `../RUNNABLE/seattle_mac` and so on 
have the platform-specific files.

Change into `../RUNNABLE`, and adapt `rebuild_base_installers.py` to
reflect your local installation. This includes the softwareupdater
cryptographic key pair to use, and the username for whom and the
destination path into which to package and copy the base installers.

Once configured, run `rebuild_base_installers.py`. This copies the generic
and  platform-specific stuff into base installer directories, and creates the
actual base installer zip/gz/tar.gz files that the Custom Installer Builder
expects. Lastly, copies over the newly-built base installer to the CIB's
`installers/base` directory.
